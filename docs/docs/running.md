First make sure that Alcali is correctly installed.

You can verify installation by running:

```commandline
alcali current_version

```

You  can also check that Alcali can access `salt` database and that [needed env var](configuration.md) are set and loaded by running:

```commandline
alcali check
# db: ok
# env: ok
```

## First Run

```commandline
alcali migrate
```

### Create a super user

```commandline
alcali createsuperuser
